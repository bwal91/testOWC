    Shopping in Bangalore can be great fun, and for the newcomer, several
    familiar brands and products are available in the shops, making you feel
    instantly at home.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The city can be divided into two main shopping areas â€“ the Cantonment area
    (MG Road, Residency, Brigade, St. Marks, Commercial, and Infantry) and the
    City area (Majestic, City Market, Chickpet, Avenue Road, and BVK Iyengar
    Road).
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The Cantonment area is full of shopping malls, internationally known
    stores, and local Department stores such as Westside and Landmark. The City
    area is comprised of small shops and stalls where bargaining is
    commonplace, and the variety of goods on sale is overwhelming. Factory
    outlet shopping is located in Marathahalli.
