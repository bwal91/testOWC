                OWC funds and serves the needs of 22 charities in the greater
                Bangalore area. These charities cover a wide spectrum of the
                underprivileged, including the destitute, terminally ill and
                HIV+ patients, orphans, women in need, the elderly, and
                physically and mentally challenged individuals. There are many
                factors to consider before volunteering with a charity. It is
                important to first feel well settled in Bangalore before
                undertaking any volunteer work. You should also think carefully
                about your time constraints, the type of work you enjoy doing,
                as well as the nature and length of your commitment to doing
                volunteer work. Changing or stopping your involvement abruptly
                affects both the charitiesâ€™ delivery of services, as well as
                your relationship with the clients. Finally, it is important to
                remember that volunteering is a two way process where you not
                only give to the charity but also receive unique benefits in
                terms of learning and developing new skills.
